Multimodal AI: Audio search

Problem statement name
Effective retrieval from audio transcripts
Overview


You have audio recordings across conversations, each containing two speakers. How might you achieve
effective hybrid search (e.g. both keyword + semantic search) across them? What diarization, database,
embeddings, and indexing strategies might result in “ideal” retrieval quality at scale? Moreover: What
metrics are important to consider should this system be brought to production, and what might constitute
an effective evaluation of the system?
Tech stack


● Python or Typescript preferred
● Some RDBS with embedding support such as Postgres and 

Restrictions

● A coding agent may be used, but you must explain how you collaborated with (prompted)
the agent to arrive at your solution.
Task

1. Construct an effective golden dataset of 5-6 audio files of 8-10 minutes length. Each should have a
unique set of two speakers. You may use recordings of interviews, or podcasts.
2. Decide what you feel an effective hybrid search strategy might be across these audio files. Users
should be able to search for both specific words uttered, as well as terms semantically similar to
their query.
3. Implement a hybrid search solution across them using a locally run solution. Transcripts should be
generated from each audio file. Searching for a term should return results highlighting the
containing file, timestamp, and speaker. Embedding generation and indexing should run locally;
transcription may use a hosted or local solution.

4. Evaluate the success of your solution by creating automated tests that measure the recall@k of
your solution against a small labeled query set.


Submission format

● Details about your solution, including an explanation of your engineering design, your rationale for
it, definition of success criteria for your solution, level of achievement against your criteria, and any
limitations of your solution, in a Markdown or PDF file
● Disclosure of coding agent use: You must disclose the use of coding agents in developing your
project. Where used, you must explain how you directed the agent to arrive at the outputs it
generated. This may be achieved by sharing documentation of the architectural requirements you
supplied to the agent, or by providing summarized traces of your interactions with the agent.
● GitHub/GitLab for code commit containing your solution, as well as your golden dataset and tests
